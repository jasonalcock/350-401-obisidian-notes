# [[Multicast]]

Some multicast addresses are reserved for single hop protocols such as Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP), VLAN
Trunk Protocol (VTP), Dynamic ISL (DISL), and Dynamic Trunk Protocol (DTP), and are been programmed to not flood. STP Uplinkfast uses a new address so the frames are flooded throughout the broadcast domain 01-00-0C-CC-CC-CC.
