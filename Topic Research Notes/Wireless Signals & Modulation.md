Wireless signal propagation is achieved by applying AC via an antenna. Electric and magnetic fields propregate at right angles to one another. Receivers induce the electric & magnetic signal. Wave properties:
- Frequency 1 complete up/down revolution sort of like a circle.
- Hertz is 1 complete cycle per seconds.
- The wireless waves belong in the microwave section of the continuous wave spectrum.
- Waves on the spectrum are defined by Hz in the range from 0 Hz to 10^21 Hz for radio broadcasting and cosmic ray ways.
- Wireless LANs are 2.4 to 6 Ghz
- A range of frequencies is called a band e.g. AM Band is 530 kHz to 1710 kHz
- We should really call wireless then the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands. The 2.4 and 5 are the centre points.
- The wireless bands are also broken down into smaller bands by Unlicensed Information Infrastructure (U-NNI).
- Bands are divided into channels, again the channel frequency will be the centre frequency and noting completely operates in one frequency and will always overlap into other frequencies.
- The frequency needed to operate a channel is bandwidth.
- The 2.4 GHz band in Wi-Fi spans from 2.400 GHz to 2.4835 GHz and is 0.0835 GHz wide.
- 2.4 GHz band from 2.400 to 2.4835 GHz, divided into 11 channels of 22 MHz bandwidth but channels spaced by 5 MHz.
- Channels are 22 MHz wide but spaced only 5 MHz apart, leading to overlap.
- The non-overlapping channels are 1, 6, and 11.
