# [[Study Techniques]]

## What Makes Study Memorable:

- *Find* whats relevant or weighted or critical.
- *Comprehension* If we read it did we understand it?
- *Make it memorable* for as long as we need to know it.
	- Read/listen it over & over then just hope but there is a strategy.

## How Do I Know The Things That I Already Know

For example how do I know my door number, someone's hair etc.
- We recall images then we use that image to answer the question.
- Images are useful for declarative facts and process

If I picture my car and then I can talk about it then I can go into details about it.

A phone number can be recalled by an image of numbers to.

Describing images reenforce memory.

How do I locate my car in a car park? I have a good look round and make images or snapshots.

If the car next to mine is the same colour I would compare the two cars using my stored images of my car, then looking at the cars and I would then be able to see that that car seat,  scratch, roof racks do not exist in my image.

I use this comparison to find recall info I need.

## How Does My Mind Work

We tend to *create static images that are the most important things* we need. So I can picture my car inside but I couldn't recall the miles on the odometer. 

We can take in too much info and too light.

Talking through how to fry an egg, the process I used to *communicate and describe was based on moving images in my head* of me doing the task.

When we *learn processes* we do not *imagine ourselves doing it* and this helps us reenforce our learning and commitment to memory.

I never do this?!!!!!! This is also useful for finding gaps. So walking and talking our way through this helps.

Find the things that are hard, confusing and frustrating and that is where we concentrate.

We use maps locate ourselves and connect to detail. We can *use maps to zoom in and out of and recall more detail or access more images*. So build maps.

There is no such thing as a bad memory if you are functioning in day to day life.

## Techniques for Recall of Terms, Facts & Numbers

By trying to forget a number we keep seeing it. Blue Elephant. Let's not make our memory hopeful but apply some techniques to recall it.

If I do not try recall something it won't stick. E.g. a number
**29** ==705==

I am taking an image of the above number. Breaking it down, into chunks, colouring it, saying it backwards. This is a good method for static stuff like:
- Numbers
- Dates
- Facts
- Terms
- Items

e.g. spelling like seperate is wrong then make an image of

sep==A==rate

Make the image of the word big, bizarre, make teh A stand our, say it out loud by talking about the image. 

## Techniques for Remembering Terms, Facts, and Numbers

Floating facts like not remembering where they put something somewhere. They don't create references. E.g. shopping list.

eggs, milk, broccoli, lettuce, sausages, foil, chocolate & lottery ticket

Humour is great and so is shock and surprise for memory.

Create a humorous shocking absurd story, say it aloud and describe it, recall it backwards. This process can all be done in our heads.

We use this and end up using similar themes to describe our stories like humour, making things different colours, turning things into goo, making stuff explode, melt, disappear 

## How Do I Apply These Techniques When Studying for a Cisco Exam?

Make stories, images, see myself doing it and describe it.

E.g. length of an Ethernet cable b4 problems 100m

We can link the cable length to an image of a a track, cable tied to bolt and it snaps when bolt gets to the end.

What does the T stand for 10 BASE-T

Don't do too much in one session!!! Stop and reenforce.

## Next Steps and Avoiding Pitfalls When Using the Memory Techniques

Practice this all the time with everything I am doing this so I can build up my strategy and learning process.

- In beginning 10 or 20 facts can be too much at beginning.
- Chunks could be too big.
- I'll never remember dialogue so ensure I know where my direction is and what it is I need to learn.
- Every hour I need to bring back my images otherwise I cannot strengthen my memory/ images.
- E.g. 4000 pages feels overwhelming and think about time in smaller increments. I know if I do something everyday it will get done. Find what's relevant, make it memorable and recall. Anything of value
- Keep an eye on measured changes helps with motivation.
- Test ourselves, do I know it? What are the gaps? If you find them work on them otherwise recall will be hard? Can I teach this to someone then I know I know it.

If I get stuck use above.

## Techniques for Finding and Remembering a Topic

Looking at article. I see title "About Building New Habits".
![[Pasted image 20241004114138.png]]
We should find:
1. The subject in the titles. Stop when I find this out and create an image of what it is.
2. Then using things like subject headings, table of contents, chapters build a map of what is info the author is trying to tell us on the topic. again create an image.
3. Then dipping into the 1st section work out what the author is saying there then stop and again add this to the map. e.g. defines a word or sets the language and meaning. What question is being answered. Mind image might look like ![[Pasted image 20241004113217.png]]
4. I am mapping out a document in my head.
5. ![[Pasted image 20241004113522.png]] Now I can stop and talk around this document.
6. Building my memory for the details and task. My outcomes tell me how much detail I need. If I need it for a discussion then maybe not so much, if I need to configure or troubleshoot then again I need to think about what level of detail I need to determine what I need to extract from the document.
7. Now I ask *how or why is this true*?
8. I am essentially flushing out what I need from the document and asking or answering ![[Pasted image 20241004114222.png]]

Getting out of the habit of reading from top to bottom which end up with poor images. Look for images, bold text, headings so you can extract the info you need.

## Notes

When you've left you can go back to and refresh
Can't right full sentences, keywords, circles, write backwards they are attractive, use blank paper, key points, facts, diagrams then use it for refreshing the data.
