## OSPF

## Neighbour States

Diana And I went for 2EE in Lions Feed

Down, Attempt, Init, 2way, exstart, exchange, loading, full

## STP

Indirect link and direct link failure think 3 switches 1, 2 and 3 in ring. RP on switch 2 fails then switch 2 has direct link failure and switch 3 has indirect link failure.

## Scaling Numbers
Adjusting the **numerical representation** of a quantity to either highlight its size or make it more manageable to comprehend. When you use a larger unit (like gigabytes or terabytes), you present the data in a way that emphasises its magnitude. If you’re discussing storage capacity, expressing it in terabytes can make it easier for people to grasp the concept of “large capacity” compared to bytes.

- Think of distance when dealing with data volume units e.g. 1 m vs 1 Km
- **1 GB = 1,000 MB** → **1000** seems large but represents a smaller numerical value when viewed as GB.
- When adjusting data volume units think of zooming (Yotta to Kilo) and out (Kilo to Yotta) and scale.
- Zoom in the absolute number or object gets larger so move decimal to right.
- Zoom out the absolute number or object gets smaller so move decimal to left.

Kilo- means 1,000; a Kilobyte is one thousand bytes.
Mega- means 1,000,000; a Megabyte is a million bytes.
Giga- means 1,000,000,000; a Gigabyte is a billion bytes.
Tera- means 1,000,000,000,000; a Terabyte is a trillion bytes.
Peta- means 1,000,000,000,000,000; a Petabyte is 1,000 Terabytes.
Exa- means 1,000,000,000,000,000,000; an Exabyte is 1,000 Petabytes.
Zetta- means 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000; a Zettabyte is 1,000 Exabytes.
Yotta- means 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000; a Yottabyte is 1,000 Zettabytes.

1. Convert 835GBs to MBs?
2. Convert 85GHz to MHz?
3. A switch interface is running at 10000 Gbps, zoom out and make this easier and talk about?
4. A ping took 0.0001 seconds so zoom in and make this number more easier to talk about?
