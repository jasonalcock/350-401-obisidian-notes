What Are The Main Topics

## My Book

Chapter 8, OSPF: I learn core concepts of OSPF, establishing neighbourships and exchanging routes.

 Chapter 9, Advanced OSPF:  Functions and features found in larger enterprise networks. Route advertisement within a multi-area OSPF domain, path selection, and techniques to optimise an OSPF environment.
 
 Chapter 10, OSPFv3: This chapter explains how the OSPF protocol has changed to accommodate support of IPv6.

I'm an Link State protocol I keep a DB of all routers and their link states

OSPF load balancing

OSPF path selection

OSPF path operations

OSPF metrics

OSPF area types
